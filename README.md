# Chatbot

A Chatbot made using Python, Tensorflow and NLTK.
  
*intents.json* contains
- Different conversations that can currently be had with the chatbot. The json file contains speech patterns and responses for the bot to indentify and reply with the response most likely to be correct based on the user's input.
- More intents can be added to this file to allow the chatbot to recognise and correctly respond the more different scenarios.
  
*Chatbot.ipynb* contains the Python code for pre-processing data, creating a model and predicting responses from the user's input.
